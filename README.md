I'm at the beginning of a career shift. Or, probably? We'll see; the present creates the past. I've got significant breadth in technical roles. I've been a software engineer in a variety of functions, and managed other engineers a couple times, too. But this year I've been on a break and finding that I really enjoy the interpersonal aspects of work the most. I like collaborating, debating, and exploring. I'm also pretty damn good at talking, to both technical and non-technical audiences. So I'm currently looking for something that combines these: solutions architect, pre- or post-sales engineer, maybe a learning or education role? Yeah!
