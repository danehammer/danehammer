<!--
**danehammer/danehammer** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

I'm not looking, per se, but if you've got an important problem to solve, that the world would be better for, I might be interested. Examples are electronic medical records and democratizing education. Buckets of money might be acceptable, too.
